Stylii
======

Stylii is a CSS toolkit for [Stylus](learnboost.github.io/stylus/). It is not a CSS framework, in that it doesn't provide any default styling, rather it provides a series of useful resets, mixins, functions and associated **tools** to aid in frontend development.

Checkout the responsive helpers, they're particularly helpful.
